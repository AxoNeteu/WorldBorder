WorldBorder
===========

Yeah... I plan on updating this plugin.. not a confirmed dev to take up BrettFlan's project, but I will keep worldborder alive somewhat...

Don't come reporting issues if you are not using this version on servers 1.15+ only.

This plugin is intended to efficiently provide a border for each of your worlds, which only people granted special bypass access are allowed beyond. These borders can be round/elliptic or square/rectangular. As the plugin has been written with performance as the most important goal, it should have no performance impact on your server. Additional world trimming and filling commands are available as well.
